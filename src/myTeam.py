 This function should return a list of two agents that will form the
 team, initialized using firstIndex and secondIndex as their agent
 index numbers.  isRed is True if the red team is being created, and
 will be False if the blue team is being created.
 As a potentially helpful development aid, this function can take
 additional string-valued keyword arguments ("first" and "second" are
 such arguments in the case of this function), which will come from
 the --redOpts and --blueOpts command-line arguments to capture.py.
 For the nightly contest, however, your team will be created without
 any extra arguments, so you should make sure that the default
 behavior is what you want for the nightly contest.
